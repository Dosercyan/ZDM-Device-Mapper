## Introduction

Device Mapper for Zoned based devices: ZDM for short.
This project aims to present a traditional block device for Host Aware and Host
Managed zoned block device drives. ZDM presents to the drive a workload that
conforms to the Host Aware intended use or Host Managed constraints.

## Architecture

ZDM implements a translation layer between a the tradition block interface
and a zoned block device (ZBD) supporting the ZBC or ZAC command set. ZDM
utilizes the available conventional space on a ZBD drive for storing the
translation layer mapping data. The device configuration should include a
minimum of 0.1% of the drive capacity  as conventional space, however 0.2%
is currently preferred and most tested. The current design assumes the
conventional space is located at the low LBA range of the partition or the
drive. The preferred layout is a typical GPT partitioned drive with a large
single partition [ex: parted -s /dev/sdX mkpart 1MiB -- -1].

It is recommended that ZDM be configured to allocate 1%, the default, of the
drive capacity as over provisioning used to manage the garbage collection of
stale blocks.

ZDM supports the BLKDISCARD IOCTL issued by blkdiscard(). It is recommended
that filesystems are mounted with the -o discard option.

The initial implementation focuses on drives with same sized zones of 256 MiB.
In future the support for other zones sizes will be added.
Internally all addressing is on 4-KiB (4k) boundaries. Currently a 4k PAGE_SIZE
is assumed. Architectures with 8k (or other) PAGE_SIZE values have not been
tested and are likely broken at the moment.

Drives of the more restrictive Host Managed device type are expected to work
provided the required amount of conventional space is available.

## Software Requirements

  - Current Linux Kernel v4.4 to v.4.8 with ZDM patches
  - Recommended: Util Linux with ZDM patches
  - Recommended: sg3utils (1.41 or later)

## Caveat Emptor - Warning

  - ZDM software is a work in progress, subject to change without
    notice and is provided without warranty for any particular
    intended purpose beyond testing and reference. The ZDM may
    become unstable, resulting in system crash or hang, including
    the possibility of data loss.
    No responsibility for lost data or system damage is assumed by
    the creators or distributors of ZDM software.
    Users explicitly assume all risk associated with running
    the ZDM software.

## Current restrictions/assumptions

  - All zones are 256 MiB.
  - 4k page or block size.
  - Host Aware zoned block device, possibly with conventional zones.
  - Host Managed zoned block device with conventional zones.
  - Currently 256 MiB of RAM per drive is recommended.
  - SAS controller SAT supports ZBC <-> ZAC translation.

## Userspace utilities
  - zdm-tools: zdmadm, zdm-status, zdm-zones, zdmon and others ...
  - util-linux: blkid, blkreport and blkzonecmd

## Typical Setup

  - Reset all WPs on drive:
```
      sg_reset_wp --all /dev/sdX
```
or
```
      blkzonecmd --reset --all /dev/sdX
```
or
```
      zdm-zonecmd --reset --all --sat /dev/sdX
```

  - Partition the drive to start the partition at a WP boundary.
```
      parted -s /dev/sdX mklabel gpt
      parted -s mkpart primary 1MiB -- -1
```

  - Place ZDM drive mapper on /dev/sdX
```
      zdmadm -F -c /dev/sdX1
```

  - Format:
```
      mkfs -t ext4 -E discard /dev/mapper/zdm_sdX1
```
or
```
      mkfs -t ext4 -b 4096 -g 32768 -G 32 \
        -E offset=0,num_backup_sb=0,packed_meta_blocks=1,discard \
        -O flex_bg,extent,sparse_super2 /dev/mapper/zdm_sdX1
```

  - Mounting the filesystem.
```
      mount -o discard /dev/mapper/zdm_sdX1 /mnt/zdm_sdX1
```

Building:
  - Normal kernel build with CONFIG_DM_ZDM

## Standards Versions Supported

ZAC/ZBC standards are still being developed. Changes to the command set and
command interface can be expected before the final public release.
