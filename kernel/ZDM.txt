BUG: Increase lazy drop delay to 15s

While fixing the memory leak introduced during _maybe_undrop()
failing to re-add the page to the ZLT pool the default hold
time in the lazy drop pool was reduced to 5s.

This does not appear to be enough settle time for the SAS HBA
controller. It also indicates a deeper issue with DIRTY and
FLUSH flag handling that may need to be moved directly into
the z_mapped_sync() handler.

In the meantime restore the 15s default and determine if that
is enough time to not regress from r104.
